       <div> <ul><li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>

           <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li> 
            
           <li>¼ cup rolled oats</li> 
            
           <li>1¼ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            
           <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li> 
            
           <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li> 
            
           <li>¼ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li> 
            
           <li>1¾ cups buttermilk</li> 
            
           <li>1 large egg</li> 
            
           <li>2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste</li> 
            
           <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li></ul></div>

                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
               </li>
               <li>
                Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.
               </li>
               <li>
                Beat buttermilk, egg, honey, and orange zest together in a bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture, currants, and raisins into flour mixture; stir with a wooden spoon until a wet, sticky dough comes together.
               </li> 
               <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface; press dough together into a soft ball of dough and cut into 2 pieces. Form each half into a smooth, round loaf. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut a 1/2-inch deep "X" into the top of each loaf with a serrated knife.</li>
               <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and fragrant, about 45 minutes. Transfer loaves to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
